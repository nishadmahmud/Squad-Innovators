        excerpt: "A comprehensive guide to choosing the right development approach for your mobile app, weighing performance against cost and speed.",
        content: "Choosing between native and cross-platform development is a critical decision for any mobile app project. Native apps offer superior performance and access to device-specific features, but they require separate codebases for iOS and Android. Cross-platform frameworks like Flutter and React Native allow you to build for both platforms with a single codebase, reducing development time and cost. The right choice depends on your budget, timeline, and performance requirements.",
